1) In rag if you want to trace every step of rag like pdf loading, chunking, splitting you need to use "from langsmith import traceable" library and perform decorators on it. 

2) runs (every step of trace), trace (one experiment of project (one time run)), project (group of traces/dashboard). 

3) in rag 1 there are multiple problems : 
    a) it is rerruning fully again and not loading from retriving step, like loading pdf again, splitting again 

    b) unable to trace functions which donot include .invoke() for example loading pdf, store in vector db this is not traced by rag here 

4) in rag 2 problems : 
    a) problem a is still there, 
    b) problem b is solved 
    c) but there are individual trace for same pipeline like (1 trace for load, chunk, split and store) 1 trace for (retrieve and fetching.) 

5) in rag 3 problems 
    here only a) problem remains. 

6) in rag 4 everything is solved.
